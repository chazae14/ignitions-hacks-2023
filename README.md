Created a prototype website for IgnitionHacks Hackathon. 
With three other people, a website-prototype was coded in 36-hours as a submission for the hackathon. The purpose of the website was to give careers and university programs suggestions to the user, depending on selected interests and grade level. 
- Used HTML and CSS for the user interface. 
- Python (Flask) was used to code the AI and backend. 
- Linux was used to run the website in browser. 
- GitHub and Visual Studio were used for the coding and submission of the project. 
- Flowcharts were used for the planning of the website and code.
